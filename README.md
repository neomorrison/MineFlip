# MineFlip
**A gambling game similar to one from Stake.com. Originally inspired by Minesweeper.
**
**The game:** Select the amount of mines you want to go against and randomly try to pick the square that doesn't contain the mine.

**Purpose:** I made this game so I could gamble without losing real life money.

**Features: **
  - Difficulty Selection
  - Ongoing gameplay (automatically resets)
  - Sound effects (Royalty Free)
  - Varied sized icons (based on Win / Loss)
